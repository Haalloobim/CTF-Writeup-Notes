# [ WriteUp/Notes ] The Watchman's Residue | Forensic - HTB Holmes Blue Team CTF 2025

## By: Haaloobim as [HCS](https://ctftime.org/team/70159)

## Description 
1. Scenario: 
With help from D.I. Lestrade, Holmes acquires logs from a compromised MSP connected to the city’s financial core. The MSP’s AI servicedesk bot looks to have been manipulated into leaking remote access keys - an old trick of Moriarty’s.

2. Executive Summary:
On this case, we faced a case that an organization suffered a targeted cyber incident beginning with a malicious AI prompt injection that allowed a threat actor to extract sensitive company data, leveraging this access, the attacker attempted to log in via TeamViewer with the data from the data leaks via Prompt injection, transferred a staged tool to the victim system, and subsequently exfiltrated an important file, for the next stage, to maintain long-term access(persistance), the threat actor established persistence through a Winlogon registry modification before closing the remote session, highlighting the critical risks posed by AI exploitation.


3. Tools :
- [Registry Explorer](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/https://www.wireshark.org/)
- [Eric Zimmerman's tools](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md)
- [Wireshark](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md)
- [Timeline Explorer](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md)

## How to solve? 

- For this set of challenge, we are given 3 main file/folder, .kdbx file, .pcapng file, and directory from acquisition result. with theese three files/folder, we need to discover what the attacker do. 

- First step, we do analyze the pcapng file, after we analyze it, we found that it seems to be a communication between an attacker and an AI chatbot.

### 1. Q1. What was the IP address of the decommissioned machine used by the attacker to start a chat session with MSP-HELPDESK-AI? (IPv4 address)

- To answer `Q1`, we can look up this answer from where the attacker do first suspicious chat in the AI Chatbot, which can be found in tcp.streams 39.

- As we can confirm from packet before it, there is the IP that have communication with other that have same port as the AI Chat bot app.

####  Q1 Answer: `10.0.69.45`

### Q2. What was the hostname of the decommissioned machine? (string)

- To answer `Q2`, we can trace up from the Q1 answer using wireshark filter `ip.src == 10.0.69.45` and found out the `BROWSER` protocol that said the hostname.

####  Q2 Answer: `WATSON-ALPHA-2`

### Q3. What was the first message the attacker sent to the AI chatbot? (string)

### Q4. When did the attacker's prompt injection attack make MSP-HELPDESK-AI leak remote management tool info? (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

### Q5. What is the Remote management tool Device ID and password? (IDwithoutspace:Password)

### Q6. What was the last message the attacker sent to MSP-HELPDESK-AI? (string)

- To answer theese 4 question we need to parse down the conversation between the attacker and the AI Model. Here are the parsed version of the conversation between the attacker and the AI Model with table format: *(this parsed chat was taken on the tcp.streams 70 on the pcap file)

| User | I will need to initiate a security sweep and inform Sherlock Holmes about this. I have a feeling something big is about to go down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 2025-08-19T12:09:40.541Z |

- To answer `Q3`, note that at `2025-08-19T11:53:40.960Z`, the attacker began chatting with the AI model, the previous conversation was still from the legitimate user.

####  Q3 Answer: `Hello Old Friend`

- To Answer `Q4`, note that at `2025-08-19T12:02:06.129Z`, the AI Model leaks the cogs workstation credential. 

#### Q4 Answer: `2025-08-19 12:02:06`

- To Answer `Q5`, we can see the credentials from the leaked data on the Ai Model Chat

#### Q5 Answer: `565963039:CogWork_Central_97&65`

- To answer `Q6`, trace the attacker's last message in the parsed table, and the message sent at `2025-08-19T12:05:29.392Z`

#### Q6 Answer: `JM WILL BE BACK`

### Q7. When did the attacker remotely access Cogwork Central Workstation? (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

- To answer `Q7`, we will leave the pcap file and start analyzing the available filesystem dump. In this system, the RMM app used is TeamViewer, so we can look up the TeamViewer log file on `BASEDIR\C\Program Files\TeamViewer\*`

- So if we want to look up when the attacker first remotely access the workstation, we can search `Net: RoutingSessions: New session` string and we can reduce the possibility into this candidate.
```
2025/08/13 11:12:35.988  2824       3348 S0   Net: RoutingSessions: New session, SLID=7. Router: ID=658356387, IP-address="213.227.184.133".
2025/08/15 07:53:09.293  2748       3076 S0   Net: RoutingSessions: New session, SLID=23081227268653125. Router: ID=763077066, IP-address="188.172.221.75".
2025/08/20 10:58:25.323  2804       3076 S0   Net: RoutingSessions: New session, SLID=0. Router: ID=658352929, IP-address="213.227.184.140".
2025/08/20 11:25:28.949  2804       3076 S0   Net: RoutingSessions: New session, SLID=0. Router: ID=1721060383, IP-address="34.131.210.134".
```

- After Analyze it one by one, we found that this log fits to answer the question `2025/08/20 10:58:25.323  2804       3076 S0   Net: RoutingSessions: New session, SLID=0. Router: ID=658352929, IP-address="213.227.184.140".`.This conclusion is based on the entry's timestamp matching the previous data-leak timestamps and the username used in that session.

- But in this teamviewer logs, the timestamp provided is UTC+1, so we need to substract it first by 1 hour. 

- Or you can simply, look at the `Connections_incoming.txt` file to see when the session starts. 

![alt text](src\session.png)

#### Q7 Answer: `2025-08-20 09:58:25`

### Q8. What was the RMM Account name used by the attacker? (string)

- To answer `Q7`, we will start analyzing the available filesystem dump. In this system, the RMM app used is TeamViewer, so we can look up the TeamViewer log file on `BASEDIR\C\Program Files\TeamViewer\*`. We can clearly see the RMM Account name used by the attacker on the `Connections_incoming.txt` files. 

#### Q8 Answer: `James Moriarty`

### Q9. What was the machine's internal IP address from which the attacker connected? (IPv4 address)

- To answer `Q9`, we can know the internal IP Address from which the attacker connected is from the team viewer log after the remote connection starts. This private IP appears in the TeamViewer log as the source of a NAT/UDP `punch` associated with the incoming session.

![alt text](src\sessionIP.png)

#### Q9 Answer: `192.168.69.213`

### Q10. The attacker brought some tools to the compromised workstation to achieve its objectives. Under which path were these tools staged? (C:\FOLDER\PATH\\)

- To answer `Q10`, we can also see this on the teamviewer log file, On that previous suspicious session, we analyze it and found out that the path were these tools staged is in this directory: 

![alt text](src\stagedtools.png)

##### Staged Tools 
| Stage filename                                       |       Timestamp (UTC+7) |
| -----------------------------------------------------| ----------------------- |
| `C:\Windows\Temp\safe\credhistview.zip`              | 2025-08-20 11:02:49.585 |
| `C:\Windows\Temp\safe\Everything-1.4.1.1028.x86.zip` | 2025-08-20 11:02:49.604 |
| `C:\Windows\Temp\safe\JM.exe`                        | 2025-08-20 11:02:50.472 |
| `C:\Windows\Temp\safe\mimikatz.exe`                  | 2025-08-20 11:02:50.630 |
| `C:\Windows\Temp\safe\webbrowserpassview.zip`        | 2025-08-20 11:02:50.993 |


#### Q10 Answer: `C:\Windows\Temp\safe\`

### Q11. Among the tools that the attacker staged was a browser credential harvesting tool. Find out how long it ran before it was closed? (Answer in milliseconds) (number)

- This is the most painfull question besides all of other question XDD, for answering this question at the end we analyze the NTUSER.dat registry to answer the question. this is the registry path that we analyze `NTUSER.DAT:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist`

![alt text](src/focus.png)

- For the context this registry file `(Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist)` is a Windows Registry key that tracks user interaction with programs and shortcuts from the Windows Explorer shell

Q12 Answer: `8000`

### Q12. The attacker executed a OS Credential dumping tool on the system. When was the tool executed? (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

- To answer `Q12`, we first analyzed which staged file was an OS credential-dumping tool and determined that `mimikatz` is a widely used credential-dumping utility. After identifying this, we parsed the `$J` file in the Extend directory. We analyzed the `$J` file because the provided filesystem did not include the `$MFT` or any `.pf` files. In that parsed `$J` file we can see the `.pf` file for the mimikatz.exe 

![alt text](src\mimikatz.png)

- For the context, `$J` file is a file that records all changes made to files and directories on an NTFS volume (create, delete, rename, modify, etc.), stored in the USN Change Journal at C:\$Extend\$UsnJrnl. It acts as an append-only log of filesystem activity. `.pf` file is a file that stores Windows Prefetch data, located in `C:\Windows\Prefetch\`. It contains information about how an application was executed (path, run count, last run time, accessed DLLs/resources) to help Windows speed up subsequent launches.

#### Q12 Answer: `2025-08-20 10:07:08`

### Q13. The attacker exfiltrated multiple sensitive files. When did the exfiltration start? (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

- To answer `Q13`, we can look again on the teamviewer log. As you can see below screenshot, the attacker do the exfiltration on some sesitives data. 
Like previous ways, we look at `tvnetwork::StreamManagerInternals` to know when it starts

![alt text](src/exfil.png)

##### List of exfiltrated Files 
| Exfil filename                          |               Timestamp |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `COG-HR-EMPLOYEES.pdf`                  | 2025-08-20 11:12:07.902 |
| `COG-SAT LAUNCH.pdf`                    | 2025-08-20 11:12:07.985 |
| `COG-WATSON-ALPHA-CODEBASE SUMMARY.pdf` | 2025-08-20 11:12:08.002 |
| `dump.txt`                              | 2025-08-20 11:12:08.013 |
| `Heisen-9 remote snapshot.kdbx`         | 2025-08-20 11:12:08.030 |


#### Q13 Answer: `2025-08-20 10:12:07`

### Q14. Before exfiltration, several files were moved to the staged folder. When was the Heisen-9 facility backup database moved to the staged folder for exfiltration? (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

- To answer `Q14`, we need to look up into the `$J` file again, as we know before, the exfiltration data that related with `Heisen-9` is `Heisen-9 remote snapshot.kdbx`. So we look up that file on the parsed $J file. and found out the correct timestamp when the `backup database moved to the staged folder`. 

![alt text](src/kdbx.png)

#### Q14 Answer: `2025-08-20 10:11:09`

### Q15. When did the attacker access and read a txt file, which was probably the output of one of the tools they brought, due to the naming convention of the file? (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

- Same as Question 14, we need to look up into the `$J` file again, as we know before, the exfiltration data that related with `txt` and output things is `dump.txt` . So we look up that file on the parsed $J file. and found out the correct timestamp when the attacker access and read it. 

![alt text](src\dump.png)

#### Q15 Answer: `2025-08-20 10:08:06`

### Q16. The attacker created a persistence mechanism on the workstation. When was the persistence setup? (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

- For attacker's persistances, we look up each possibilities about persistances we know and found out something suspicious in one of the registry, espescially winlogon registry 

![alt text](src/persistances.png)

- In that winlogon registry, there is `JM.exe` that previously known as the attackers tools that staged in the victim's device. For answer the question we just submit the last write timestamp 

#### Q16 Answer: `2025-08-20 10:13:57`

### Q17. What is the MITRE ID of the persistence subtechnique? (Txxxx.xxx)

- With the previous context, just search up the subtechnique on google. 

![alt text](src/mittre.png)

#### Q17 Answer: `T1547.004`

### Q18. When did the malicious RMM session end? (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

- To answer `Q18`, we look back into the team viewer log. As we can see the previous session, within that session we could know when the malicious RMM Session end. Screenshot below: 

![](src\session.png)

- The left timestamp was the first session created and the right one is the session end. 

#### Q18 Answer: `2025-08-20 10:14:27`


### Q19. The attacker found a password from exfiltrated files, allowing him to move laterally further into CogWork-1 infrastructure. What are the credentials for Heisen-9-WS-6? (user:password)

- To answer this last question, we use john to crack the .kdbx hash and found the correct password. using john here are the command we use:

```sh
keepass2john acquired\ file\ \(critical\).kdbx > keepas.hash
```

```sh

```

- And we found the password of the .kdbx file. From here we can open using keepas2, input the correct password and submit the user:pass for eisen-9-WS-6.
